# CommonJS Challenge

Your task is to use CommonJS modules to get every string from directories `one` through `six`, assign them to variables, and then in the root `index.js`, simply `console.log` them all together.

The result should be something like this:

```javascript
// each one of these is a variable referencing strings imported from other files
console.log(This + is + how + we + Do + it);

// -> This is how we do it!
```
